      A computer crazy grad from <a href="https://www.amity.edu/">Amity University, Noida.</a> As, I've completed my graduation, I am eager to secure challenging roles in the field of computer science & Engineering. In the second year of my degree, I undertook an important role in the successful conduction and completion for an open-to-all hackathon at Amity University, Noida. My studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of computer engineering methods, tools, software packages and techniques. Alongside this, I have developed sound communication skills while delivering presentations to large audiences at university. As such, I am confident that I can make an instant impact in engineering roles.
